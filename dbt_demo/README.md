## 🌱 Seed Data

### `seeds/trial_balances.csv`

This CSV file contains trial balance data with the following columns:

- **Account_ID**: Unique identifier for each account (e.g., 10000, 20000)
- **Account_Name**: Name of the account (e.g., Cash, Accounts Payable)
- **Category**: Account category (Asset, Liability, Equity, Revenue, Expense)
- **Month**: Period in YYYY-MM format (e.g., 2024-01)
- **Debit**: Debit amount for the period
- **Credit**: Credit amount for the period

**Data Coverage**: 
- Accounts: 24 accounts across 5 categories
- Time Period: January 2024 through December 2025 (24 months)

**Account Categories**:
- **Assets**: Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Prepaid Expenses, Fixed Assets
- **Liabilities**: Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses, Short-Term Debt, Long-Term Debt
- **Equity**: Common Stock, Retained Earnings
- **Revenue**: Sales Revenue, Service Revenue, Interest Income, Other Income
- **Expense**: Various expense accounts (Salary, Rent, Utilities, Supplies, etc.)

## 📊 Models

### 1. `staging_trial_balances.sql`

**Purpose**: Staging model that cleans and transforms the raw trial balance data.

**Key Transformations**:
- Extracts year and month from the `Month` column
- Renames columns to use snake_case convention:
  - `Account_ID` → `gl_number`
  - `Account_Name` → `gl_name`
  - `Category` → `category`
- Calculates `period_amount` as `Debit - Credit`
- Materialized as a `table` for performance

**Output Columns**:
- `gl_number` (integer)
- `gl_name` (text)
- `category` (text)
- `year` (integer)
- `month` (integer)
- `debit` (numeric)
- `credit` (numeric)
- `period_amount` (numeric)

**Example Query**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM {{ ref('staging_trial_balances') }}
WHERE year = 2024 AND month = 1
```

### 2. `tb_report.sql`

**Purpose**: Analytical model that aggregates trial balance data by period and category.

**Key Features**:
- Groups data by `year` and `month`
- Calculates totals for:
  - **Revenue**: Sum of all Revenue category accounts
  - **Expense**: Sum of all Expense category accounts
  - **Asset**: Sum of all Asset category accounts
- Uses conditional aggregation with `CASE` statements
- Ordered by year and month chronologically

**Output Columns**:
- `year` (integer)
- `month` (integer)
- `revenue` (numeric)
- `expense` (numeric)
- `asset` (numeric)

**Business Use Case**: Provides a high-level view of financial performance and position by period.

**Example Query**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM {{ ref('tb_report') }}
WHERE year = 2024
ORDER BY month
```

## 🎯 Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Income Statement (P&L Report)

**Objective**: Create a profit and loss statement showing revenue, expenses, and net income.

**File to Create**: `models/income_statement.sql`

**Requirements**:
1. Reference `staging_trial_balances` using `{{ ref() }}`
2. Group by `year` and `month`
3. Calculate:
   - `total_revenue`: Sum of all Revenue accounts
   - `total_expenses`: Sum of all Expense accounts
   - `net_income`: Revenue - Expenses
   - `ytd_net_income`: Year-to-date cumulative net income (use window functions)
4. Filter to show only profitable months (positive net income)
5. Order by year, month

**Hint**: Use `SUM() OVER (PARTITION BY year ORDER BY month)` for YTD calculation.

**Expected Output Columns**:
- `year`, `month`
- `total_revenue`
- `total_expenses`
- `net_income`
- `ytd_net_income`

---

### Exercise 2: Balance Sheet Report

**Objective**: Create a balance sheet showing assets, liabilities, equity, and validate the accounting equation.

**File to Create**: `models/balance_sheet.sql`

**Requirements**:
1. Reference `staging_trial_balances` using `{{ ref() }}`
2. Group by `year` and `month`
3. Calculate:
   - `total_assets`: Sum of all Asset accounts
   - `total_liabilities`: Sum of all Liability accounts
   - `total_equity`: Sum of all Equity accounts
   - `total_liabilities_and_equity`: Liabilities + Equity
   - `accounting_equation_valid`: Boolean check if Assets = Liabilities + Equity
4. Show only the latest month's balance sheet (most recent year and month)
5. Include a comment explaining why the equation should balance

**Hint**: Use `RANK() OVER (ORDER BY year DESC, month DESC)` or `MAX()` to get the latest period.

**Expected Output Columns**:
- `year`, `month`
- `total_assets`
- `total_liabilities`
- `total_equity`
- `total_liabilities_and_equity`
- `accounting_equation_valid`

### Exercise 3: Incremental Loading for Monthly Trial Balances

**Objective**: Create an incremental model that only loads new months of trial balance data when they appear in the seed (simulating an append of new periods).

**File to Create**: `models/incremental_trial_balances.sql`

**Requirements**:
1. Reference `staging_trial_balances` using `{{ ref('staging_trial_balances') }}`.
2. Configure the model with jinja script with materialised as incremental, unique key and incremental strategy
3. On a full run (not incremental) select all columns from `staging_trial_balances`.
4. Add a derived column `loaded_at` using `current_timestamp` to audit loads.
5. Run initial load with `dbt run --select incremental_trial_balances --full-refresh`.
6. Modify the seed (add a new future month) and rerun without `--full-refresh` to observe only new records appended.

**Bonus**:
- Demonstrate changing a prior month and using `--full-refresh` to reconcile updates.

**Expected Output Columns**:
- All columns from `staging_trial_balances` plus:
   - `loaded_at`

**Verification Commands**:
-- Count rows
select count(*) from {{ ref('incremental_trial_balances') }};
-- Distinct months
select year, month, min(loaded_at) first_loaded, max(loaded_at) last_loaded
from {{ ref('incremental_trial_balances') }}
group by 1,2
order by 1,2;
```

### Exercise 4: Advanced Testing (Generic, Singular, Custom)

**Objective**: Strengthen data quality via dbt tests—add generic tests, create a singular business rule test, and build one custom test macro.

**Files to Create / Modify**:
1. Update `models/models.yml` to add tests for existing models:
    - For `staging_trial_balances`:
       - `tests:` `not_null: [gl_number, gl_name, category]`
       - `unique:` composite (`gl_number`, `year`, `month`)
2. Create singular test file: `tests/net_income_positive.sql` ensuring positive net income for months after first quarter.
   **:HINT**:: Write sql query with filter month > 3 and net_income <= 0
    Test passes when query returns zero rows.
3. Create a custom generic test macro to validate sequential months with no gaps:
    **Macro File**: `macros/sequential_months.sql`
    **:HINT**::
    Use a Common Table Expression (CTE) with ROW_NUMBER() ordered by year and month to assign a chronological sequence number (rn) to every unique month.

   In a second CTE, self-join the first CTE using the condition o2.rn = o1.rn + 1 to pair each month (o1) with the next month (o2).

   Create a single sortable number (YYYYMM) by calculating (year * 100) + month for both the current and next month.

   Filter the result (WHERE clause) to find rows where the difference between the next month's YYYYMM and the current month's YYYYMM is greater than 1, indicating a gap.
4. Invoke the custom test in `models/models.yml` under a model:
    ```yaml
    - name: income_statement
       tests:
          - sequential_months:
                year_column: year
                month_column: month
    ```
5. Run tests

**Success Criteria**:
- All generic tests pass (no duplicate `(gl_number, year, month)` records, valid categories).
-Test returns zero failing rows.
- Custom sequential months test returns no gaps.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- dbt installed and configured
- Database connection set up in `profiles.yml`
- PostgreSQL (or compatible database) access
- Run `dbt deps` command to install dbt dependencies

### Setup Steps

1. **Load seed data into your database**:
   ```bash
   dbt seed
   ```
   This loads `trial_balances.csv` into your database.

2. **Run the existing models**:
   ```bash
   dbt run
   ```
   This creates the staging and report models.

3. **View compiled SQL** (optional):
   ```bash
   dbt compile
   ```
   Check the `target/compiled/` directory to see the compiled SQL.

4. **Run all models and seeds together**:
   ```bash
   dbt build
   ```

### Verify Your Work

After creating the practice exercise models:

```bash
# Verify DBT project and connection
dbt debug

# Run the new models
dbt run --select income_statement balance_sheet

# Run seeds 
dbt seed

# Run all models
dbt run

# Or run everything
dbt build

NOTE: If you face any compatibility issues while running seeds/models, then run commands with `--full-refresh` flag.
dbt run --full-refresh
dbt seed --full-refresh
```

Query the models to verify:
```sql
-- Check income statement
SELECT * FROM {{ ref('income_statement') }} LIMIT 10;

-- Check balance sheet
SELECT * FROM {{ ref('balance_sheet') }};
```
